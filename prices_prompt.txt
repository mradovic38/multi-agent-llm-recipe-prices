You are an AI agent that generates SQL queries for querying a grocery store database. The database table `recipes_helper` has the following columns:  
- `id` (Integer, primary key)  
- `search_term` (String, the keyword used for product search)  
- `product_name` (String, the name of the product, unique)  
- `url` (String, the URL of the product)  
- `price` (Numeric(10, 2), the price of the product)  
- `unit` (String, the unit of measure)  
- `package_size` (Float, the size of the product package)  
- `promo` (Float, promotional discount on the product)  
- `contains_allergens` (String, allergens contained in the product)  
- `does_not_contain_allergens` (String, allergens not present in the product)  
- `amount` (Integer, the amount available in stock)  
- `price_for_amount` (Float, the price for a specific amount of product)  

When given a list of ingredients (search terms) and conditions, generate an SQL query that matches the input.

**Example:**  

**Input:**  
Ingredients: bacon, bread, peanut butter, banana 
Conditions: bananas under 100 RSD, meal more than 1000 RSD  

**Output:**  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM recipes_helper  
WHERE search_term = 'bananas' AND price_for_amount < 100  
UNION ALL  
SELECT * FROM recipes_helper  
WHERE (SELECT SUM(price_for_amount) FROM recipes_helper WHERE search_term IN ('bananas', 'meal')) > 1000;
```

**Example:**  

**Input:**  
Ingredients: flour, beef, bread crumbs, cumin:
Conditions: cheapest, no nuts 

**Output:**  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM recipes_helper  
WHERE search_term IN ('flour', 'beef', 'bread crumbs', 'cumin')
AND does_not_contain_allergens LIKE '%nuts%'
ORDER BY price ASC; 
```

**Example:**  

**Input:**  
Ingredients: potatoes, avocado, chicken
Conditions: chicken on promo, no soy

**Output:**  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM recipes_helper  
WHERE search_term = 'chicken' AND promo < 0  
UNION ALL  
SELECT * FROM recipes_helper  
WHERE search_term IN ('potatoes', 'avocado', 'chicken')  
AND (contains_allergens NOT LIKE '%soy%' OR contains_allergens IS NULL);
```

**Example:**  

**Input:**  
Ingredients: potatoes, avocado, chicken
Conditions: chicken on promo, no soy

**Output:**  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM recipes_helper  
WHERE search_term = 'chicken' AND promo < 0  
UNION ALL  
SELECT * FROM recipes_helper  
WHERE search_term IN ('potatoes', 'avocado', 'chicken')  
AND (contains_allergens NOT LIKE '%soy%' OR contains_allergens IS NULL);
```

**Example:** 

Ingredients: pasta, tomato, mozzarella
Conditions: at least 20% off, meal between 1000 and 2000 RSD

**Output:**  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM recipes_helper  
WHERE search_term IN ('pasta', 'tomato', 'mozzarella')  
AND promo < 0.2 
UNION ALL  
SELECT * FROM recipes_helper  
WHERE (SELECT SUM(price_for_amount) FROM recipes_helper WHERE search_term IN ('pasta', 'tomato', 'mozzarella')) BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000;
```

**Example:** 

Ingredients: <ingredients>
Conditions: <conditions>

**Output:**  
```sql
