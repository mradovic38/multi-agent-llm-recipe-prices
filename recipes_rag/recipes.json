Appenzeller works best. Gruyère would be my go-to alternative.\n- a jar of apple sauce\n\nFeel free to vary these amounts, it's not like this is anything strict.",
        "directions": "1. Fry bacon cubes in pot (this pot will be used for everything so choose an appropriately large one).\n2. Cut onions into half-rings and let them sweat in the same pot. Add some butter if your bacon was not fatty enough.\n3. Peel potatoes and cut them into ~1 cm/half inch cubes.\n4. When the onions have become sufficiently cooked, add potatoes.\n5. Top everything with milk and let the potatoes cook for about 10 minutes.\n7. Add macaroni and the remaining milk to cover everything. Most of the milk will be absorbed by the macaroni.\n8. Shred your cheese.\n9. A minute or two before the macaroni are done, add the shredded cheese into the pot. It should appear a bit too runny in the pot. While cooling it will increase in viscosity quite a bit. If the final texture is not creamy enough, it is most likely due to using the wrong cheese.\n10. Season to taste. (Needs quite a bit of salt). Nutmeg also works well here.\n11. Serve with apple sauce. Should be eaten together, not as a dessert."

Add the oil and garlic to the skillet and gently cook it until it's lightly golden brown.\n4. Add the red pepper flakes to the skillet and turn down the heat to let its flavor infuse the oil.\n5. When the pasta has finished cooking, drain it, and reserve at least around a cup of the cooking water.\n6. Now add the drained pasta with some of the cooking water to the skillet and toss vigorously. The starch in the pasta water will help the sauce emulsify and get it to the right consistency.\n7. At the very last second add the parsley, to preserve its freshness.

Prepare the stock, possibly the day before, by boiling fish and fish bones in a tall stock pot on medium heat for 1-2 hours. It's customary to have loose chunks of fish in the soup so you can boil the fish and separate the meat as it starts to cook. As an example, the head, tail, skin and spine from the [anglerfish fillet recipe](/fried-anglerfish-fillet) were used to make stock, then half a fillet and meat that separated from the offal became part of the soup.\n3. In a pot, heat some oil on low heat and add in the onions. Saute until translucent.\n4. Add the garlic, tomato, herbs and salt if desired. Switch to medium heat, stirring occasionally until the water starts to boil.\n5. Add the fish and let simmer on low heat until the fish are cooked thoroughly, being careful not to break them. Turn the heat off and add the olive oil.\n6. Take the fish out to be served separately. They are traditionally served topped with olive oil and a squeeze of lemon with steamed vegetables.\n7. If you are using lemon juice or rice, add them to each serving according to your preference.\n8. Leave some for tomorrow. It always tastes better the next day."

Browning the meat on the outside will give it a much nicer texture when you go to eat this and **should not be skipped for convenience**.\n3. Remove the meat and add in the vegetables. Adding some salt will help remove the moisture in the veg and will help deglaze the caramelised bits at the bottom of the pot.\n4. (Optional) If you have a Guinness or some other stout add the meat back in an deglaze with about a third of the can. This will add some extra flavour. Wait until the alcohol has completely evaporated until you stir or continue.\n5. Add back in the meat and add in the stock and herbs. Lower the heat and allow to simmer for about 2 - 2.5 hours.\n6. After 2 hours the stew will be a bit thicker but probably still watery. The easiest thing to do is add some cut up potatoes for the last half hour. The starch will help thicken the stew considerably.

Transfer the purée to a sauté pan that has been heated to medium high heat to cook. Allow the mushrooms to release their moisture; once the moisture has been boiled away take the mushrooms out of pan to cool.\n5.

Add the vinegar to help the egg whites set.\n5. **Poach Eggs 3-4 Minutes**: Gently slide the eggs into the simmering water. It helps to crack the eggs into a small bowl or ladle, bring the vessel to the surface of the water, and then drop the egg in that way. While cooking, take a spoon and stir the water into a little whirlpool; this can help displace the excess egg whites, giving the poached eggs a cleaner, firmer appearance.

Optionally butter both halves. You could substitute the muffins with any kind of spongey bread.\n8. **Cook Bacon**: In a skillet on medium heat, cook the Canadian bacon or ham until slightly browned.\n9. **Assemble**: Place a slice of Canadian bacon on each toasted muffin half, top with a poached egg and a generous amount of hollandaise sauce.

With a sharp and preferably short-bladed knife make an incision from the anus to just between the two small fins under the head. This is best done by inserting the knife blade tip facing up while putting force upwards and moving towards the head, letting gravity do the work. This helps to avoid puncturing the organs.\n2. Remove the organs. Gently pull and cut the membrane that connects each to the rest of the body.\n3. Make an incision around the mouth (the hard 'lips'), turn the fish around and do the same to that side.\n4. Start to slowly but firmly pull back the skin cutting whenever there is resistance as you make your way towards the tail.\n5. Once you have removed the skin, flip it back onto its back and cut off the thin flabs of meat of its underside and fins from the body. At this point there should be a clear distinction between the body and the larger head. Behead the animal.\n6. With a filleting knife, fillet the meat from the backbone and remove the tail.\n7. You should be left with 2 long strips of meat. Cut each in half.\n\n### Cooking\n\n8. In a pan on medium heat, melt a good amount of butter and place the fillets inside. The goal here is to sear the meat to get that light crust. Flip until all sides have turned the 'golden brown' color.\n9. Add the herbs, just enough to cover the fillets, salt and pepper too if desired and cover with the lid on low heat until fully cooked. Time here varies but it can be anywhere between 5-10 minutes.\n10. Enjoy. This goes well with steamed vegetables. Or potatoes to soak up the butter."

Cloves will make the masala really hot. So make sure to add only as much as you want to eat.\n3. Too much Mace makes the masala quite bitter. So make sure you do not add more than what has been recommended. The amount of other spices can be changed according to taste.\n4. Wash all the dry spices really well.\n5. If you live in a place which is very sunny, sun dry your washed spices for about 1 day. If not then on a frying pan with a heavy bottom, place all the spices and dry roast them until aromatic.\n6. Cool the dry spices and put them into a mixer. Mix thoroughly.\n7. Sieve the powder and add the larger pieces into the mixer once again and mix it again until everything turns into a fine powder. This step might need to be repeated a few times.\n8. The resulting mixture is garam masala. Store it in airtight glass jars.\n9. You can store this mixture for about 2/3 months in a cool dry place."

While the pan heats up, use your hands and tear off pieces of bread that are roughly the size of your hand.\n3. Make sure you have one piece of bread per egg you want to make. I've dabbled with the egg:bread ratios, and this seems to work.\n4. Once the olive oil starts smelling a bit (or smoke comes off of it), crack in however many eggs you care to eat. Turn down the heat to medium.\n5. Act fast! As the eggs start cooking, prepare a plate with two handfuls of chopped green onion and Tabasco.\n6. After about four minutes (or when the tops of the eggs start to set), take out eggs and place on top of bed of onions & Tabasco.\n7. Turn heat back to medium-high and add a touch more olive oil. Place pieces of bread in pan.\n8. Every so often, move the pieces of bread around to soak up the oil.\n9. When the bread is about to turn a good shade of golden-brown, add a generous sprinkle of Tony Chachere's to the plated eggs (on top of them).\n10. Turn off the heat and move the pan off the burner. Take out bread pieces and place on the same plate as the eggs.\n11. Serve with glass of ice-cold beer.\n\nIdeally, you won't even need a fork! Simply use the bread to guide the eggs on top of each piece, break the yolk into the piece, and take a large\nbite."

        "directions": "1. Drain and rinse the garbanzo beans.\n2. Place garbanzo beans in a small saucepan or pot, add 1 teaspoon baking soda (this alters the pH to encourage the beans to break down and shed their skins), and cover with a few inches of water. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes, until the skins begin to fall off and the beans look overcooked/mushy. You may need to reduce the heat after a few minutes to prevent boil-overs.\n3. While the garbanzo beans are boiling, combine the garlic and lemon juice with 1/4 teaspoon salt in the workbowl of your food processor. Pulse until a fine, uniform consistency is achieved. You may need to scrape down the top and sides of the bowl to ensure the garlic is chopped finely enough. Leave the mixture for at least 10 minutes for the raw garlic taste to mellow.\n4. After 20 minutes of boiling, drain the garbanzo beans and their skins in a mesh strainer, then rinse for at least 30 seconds with cold water to remove any lingering taste from the baking soda.\n5. Add the tahini to the food processor. Blend until creamy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.\n6. While the food processor is running on \"high,\" slowly drizzle in two tablespoons of ice-cold water. Continue to run on high, scraping down the bowl as necessary (1-3 times), until the mixture has enough air worked into it that it lightens in color and thickens in texture substantially.\n7. Scrape down the bowl again, then add the garbanzo beans and cumin (and za'atar, if you have it). Pulse a few times, then set the food processor to high again. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, as slowly as you can manage.\n8. Continue to process the hummus on high for at least one minute longer, up to three minutes longer if it hasn't become smooth enough yet. You can make the hummus thinner at this point by slowly adding ice water a teaspoon at a time while processing on high. Taste the hummus at this point to determine if it needs more lemon juice or more salt for flavor.\n9. Transfer the hummus into a serving bowl and smooth out the surface with the back of a spoon, creating swirls or indentations for olive oil as desired. Top with additional olive oil and optionally finely chopped fresh parsley, more za'atar, or a sprinkling of sumac (a spice mixture) or dukkah (a seed mixture).\n10.

Steep 3-5 tbsp (or 5-6 bags) of tee in 3-5 cups of water.\n4. Strain the leaves from the tea and add 2 cups of sugar (or honey).\n5. Add other optional teas to your liking; I like to add a good handful of\n   rosella tea; steep and strain this in boiling water separately.\n6. Add 4l of water to the tea concentrate and pour into a wide mouthed jar.\n7. Let the tea sit until it is less than 40°C; add ice cubes if it has to go\n   quick.\n8. Add your scoby to the jar and seal the mouth tightly with a cloth or paper\n   towel and a rubber band. The scoby has to breathe, but you want to prevent\n   insects and dirt from getting into the jar.\n9. Let the jar sit in a warm dark spot for 10-14 days.\n\nSecond brew:\n\n1. Taste the brew after 10-14 days; if it has started to carbonate and the\n   sugar is mostly gone, it is ready. The brewing time will strongly depend on\n   your personal preference, shorten or lengthen as you wish.\n2. Once ready, strain 4/5 of the brew through a sieve into re-sealable glass\n   bottles.\n3. Make another batch of primary brew and refill the big jar; the remaining old\n   brew will act as a starter. Rinse the jar and remove parts of the scoby once\n   in a while.\n4. If you wish you can add juices, fruits, or spices to your brew. These will\n   partially ferment and add a special character to your kombucha. One nice\n   addition is apple and cinnamon mixed in with green tea.\n5. Let the bottles sit in a warm dark spot for another 3-14 days; the\n   carbonation process will continue, so make sure to release pressure from the\n   bottles every other day.\n6. When you are satisfied with the carbonation and the flavor, put the bottles\n   in the fridge. Here you can store them for weeks at a time.\n7. Enjoy your kombucha, rinse, and repeat."

About 20 minutes before it is to be done take the chopped greens and put them in the soup. Don't worry if it overfills the slow cooker, the greens will shrink a ton.

Bring water to a rolling boil.\n4. Now add pasta.\n5. Keep it boiling, but decrease heat as it tries to overflow.\n6. Wait until pasta is at the preferred softness (see below), then strain it.\n7. While the pasta is sitting in your strainer, you may add basil leaves or other herbs and aromatics. I also recommend taking a knob or so of room temperature butter and add it in and stirring it, melting it into the pasta.\n\n### How long should pasta be cooked?\n\nThe often recommended way to cook most pasta is *al dente*, which often means \"slightly undercooked,\" or with a subtle firmness that makes it still substantial.\nCooking pasta more than that is no great crime,\nbut if you keep it in there for *too* long, it'll become mush."

Mince the chicken, if necessary. Mince the onions, if you desire them. Divide butter, once softened, into medium bits.\n6. Add eggs to the meat and put a few into a medium bowl; mix both bowls' contents thoroughly.\n7. Add the spices, salt and/or sauce of your choosing. Some may consider this barbaric, but I found that Heinz's mustard ketchup works exceptionally well with the recipe. They'll come out a tad red, though.\n8. Add the softened-up butter to the XL bowl and mix thoroughly.\n9. MAKE A TEST CUTLET by rolling up a small ball of the mince, then dipping it into the bread, then into the eggs, then into the bread again, compounding the breading slightly between dips. More dips means less leaked butter/juice, but don't overdo it lest you want more bread than meat in your cutlet.\n10. Fry, let cool and then taste the cutlet. (Pozharskiye are very juicy, so liquid in the pan is to be expected.)\n11. If unsatisfied, add more flavoring or throw everything away. If satisfied, repeat step 9. (Most cutlet sizes work well.

Glove your hands with latex gloves or some other kind of chemical-resistant ones and fully submerge each of the four pretzels one at a time into the lye bath for 10 seconds each. Drain each pretzel thouroughly before transfering them to baking sheets\n9. Sprinkle the crunchy finishing salt over the the pretzels and score each pretzel's belly with a knife for aesthetics and to allow it to expand more in the oven.\n10. Bake pretzels until they are deep mahogany all over. This should take around 15 minutes. The sodium hydroxide should react with the dough and harmlessly evaporate in the oven.\n11. Store or dispose the lye bath. To easily dispose of the lye bath, slowly drizzle the lye down the drain with the faucet running, to dilute it.\n12. If at any point you get lye on your skin, wash it off in the sink promptly. It may cause minor skin irritation."

Do not put all the water in as you may not need all of it. Let the dough sit for at least 10 minutes. \n3. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a large rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Place the butter in the center and fold the two ends over it so that it is fully encased in dough. Roll out the dough again, taking care to not let the butter break through the surface. Once the dough is about 1/2 inch thick again fold into thirds. The butter should be warm now, place into fridge for 30 minutes.\n4. Repeat rolling and folding two more times, then refrigerate again until firm. \n5. Repeat two or more times until the dough was rolled roughly 6 times, then wrap and refrigerate. The dough can now be used in recipes calling for puff pastry. Roll out thin, about 1/4 inch, and bake at 400 degrees F for best results."

        "directions": "1. The basic rule of thumb I use for pasta is 100g, 1 egg per person\n2. For this recipe you can go two ways, the old school \"well\" method or a kitchen aid mixer (skip to step 7)\n3. For the well method, pile the flour onto the counter and with your hand carve a hole or a well in the center\n4. Crack the eggs into the center of the well, and drizzle a bit of olive oil into the center\n5. With a fork, begin slowly breaking up, mixing, and incorporating the egg into the flour until there is no longer any loose egg that can escape the outer well border\n6. At this point use your hands to bring the sandy mixture together and knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth\n7. For the stand mixer method just throw all the ingredients into the mixer with a dough hook and set it to level 4 for about 3-5 minutes and it will be done\n8. You might need to scrape the sides down and maybe hand knead the dough a bit longer after it's done to make it into a nice smooth ball\n9. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge a bit so it's easier to roll out (15-30 mins)\n10. While the dough is resting, make the filling by first mixing the  ricotta and egg into a bowl\n11. Zest and juice a lemon peel into the bowl\n12. Optionally add seafood ingredients at this point\n13. Grate the Pecorino into the bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and mix to distribute the ingredients evenly\n14. Take out the dough and cut it into 4 pieces, keeping the ones not currently being worked on covered so they don't dry out\n15. Roll the dough out with a pasta machine down to the point where you can just barely see your hand through it (setting 2-3 out of 7) or roll it out with a rolling pin into a long sheet, maybe like 16 x 8 inches or so\n16. At this point you can either cut the sheet in half and make two sheets, a top and bottom, or one sheet, where you will fold the dough over and use the folded seam as one side of the ravioli\n\n17. Using a teaspoon, evenly space out the ricotta filling onto the sheets, leaving a few inches on each side for the seams\n18. As stated in step 16, either take the 2nd sheet and place it over top or fold over the dough and press down firmly, forcing out any air and making sure the two pieces of dough stick\n19. You may need to brush some water onto the dough if it is too heavily floured and not sticking\n20. Using a fancy pasta cutter, a knife, or even a pizza cutter, cut evenly between the seams of the raviolis to separate them\n21. If you used a pasta cutter, you are now done, store the raviolis on a floured wax paper sheet or freeze them for later\n\n22. If you don't have a pasta cutter, use a fork to press down the dough around the edges of the cut raviolis to ensure they are firmly closed and no leaks or air bubbles are visible, or else they will explode when cooked\n23. To cook, throw them in salted boiling water and they will let you know when they're done when they float to the top (1-2 minutes)\n24. Serve the seafood version with a simple fresh red sauce and basil, or spice it up a bit and go with a base of red sauce with some added heavy cream, and a pinch of red pepper flakes to make a pink sauce for the seafood version"

Put the chicken under the water and let it sit for 20-40 minutes at room temperature.\n2. Preheat the oven to 230°C / 450°F.\n3. Remove the chicken from the water. Rinse it. Dry it. Put it in a roasting pan (you can use a casserole dish, oven-safe skillet, or baking pan too).\n4. Brush the chicken with melted butter. For best results, brush all sides of the chicken breast.\n5. Season with pepper and any optional seasoning. Season with salt last.\n6. Insert the thermometer probe into the thickest part of the smallest breast.\n7. Bake until the internal temperature reaches 68°C / 155°F.\n8. Remove from the oven and immediately cover with foil leaving the probe inserted. Let the chicken sit for 10 minutes at room temperature. The chicken will continue to cook. It should reach at least 74°C / 165°F but if it doesn't, see [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/49opyx/cooking_chicken_to_temps_below_165_is_it_safe/) about food safety when cooking chicken to less than 165°F.\n9.

Dice the first onion and mix together with potatoes. You can also add diced\n   bacon if you want to. Add your seasonings here.\n4. Heat up some butter in a large pan. Add your mix to the pan on high heat.\n   Let the mixture get warm for a few minutes under constant stirring.\n5. Reduce heat to medium-high. Form the Rösti into a round cack. It should fill\n   out the whole pan. I recommend a thickness of around 1 - 1.5cm (~1/2\") for a\n   softer Rösti.\n6. Add some more butter flakes around the inside of the pan to get it under the\n   Rösti.\n7. It can take quite a while for a nice crust to form. Check after roughly 5-10\n   minutes for browning.\n8. While the Rösti is cooking dice the other onion and the carrots. Steam\n   everything in a pan with a bit of water. Use a lid to get the temperature\n   up.\n9. Alternatively you can use fresh or creamed spinach.\n10. When you're satisfied with the browning, flip the Rösti and set the heat to\n    medium-low. A plate can be useful here, put it on top of the Rösti in the\n    pan and flip. Then gently put the whole cake back in the pan.\n11. When the Rösti crispness is to your liking, remove from pan and fry two\n    eggs. A runny yolk adds quite a bit to the potatoes.\n12. Top Rösti with eggs and serve with the peas or spinach."

        "directions": "1. Combine sourdough starter with warm water, break apart and dissolve.\n2. Add flour and mix together gently to hydrate. Mixture will be very wet and sticky.\n3. Once there is no dry flour, let stand for 30 minutes (autolyze).\n4. Add sea salt.\n5. Wet hands and begin to stretch and fold dough to combine salt and to begin gluten formation.\n6. Add drops of water until dough becomes cohesive and supple with no toughness or resistance.\n7. Dough will prove on the counter top for 4 - 5 hours. About every 30 minutes, perform a stretch and fold. This involves grabbing the dough with a wet hand, folding over the top of itself, and repeating this step by turning the bowl and making your way around the dough. It will take some practice to work with a dough of this level of hydration, but will get easier!\n8. You will know fermentation is complete when small bubbles are seen on the surface around the edge of your dough. You can also perform a window pane test by grasping a pinch of dough and pulling it between your fingers. The dough should stretch enough to become see-through. This means enough gluten has formed that the dough is strong enough to hold large air bubbles as it bakes.\n9. Turn onto generously floured surface using a bowl scraper or spatula to protect the dough. Handling the dough gently will prevent deflation.\n10. Shape the dough: Take the two sides and fold them into the center of the wet dough. Then, take the top and bottom and fold them also over the center of the wet dough. Optional: grasp the edge of the dough closest to you and roll dough away from you into a tight loaf shape. Generously flour.\n11. Place into a dish about the size of the dough, a proving basket is ideal. Use a lot of flour in the bowl and on the loaf. The sides of the container should not be shallow, the goal here is to let the bread rest in the shape you want it to bake in.\n12. Refrigerate 12 - 24 hours, the longer the dough rests, the more sour your final product. I don't recommend going over 24 hours but sour dough is fun to experiment with!\n13. Bring dough to room temperature, it should feel like a water balloon, giving resistance to touch with some spring.\n14. Put one oven rack in the center and another below it, place a pan of water on the lower rack. Preheat oven to 475 - 500 degrees F, depending on oven capability. The pan of water should create steam to help the bread expand.\n15. When oven is hot, turn bread into a baking vessel. I use a 8 inch springform pan, but a dutch oven is ideal. You can use any vessel that is rated for high temperatures. If using a dutch oven, keep it covered for the first 15 minutes, and you don't need to use the pan of water.\n16. Flour the top of the loaf and score the bread with a razor blade (this is optional but creates an artisan look)\n17. Bake covered/steamed for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 425 F. If using steam, remove the water pan now.\n18. Bake for another 25 - 30 minutes until crust is a rusty color and sounds hollow when tapped.\n19. Let bread cool completely before slicing.

You can now use the starter for baking sourdough bread. Remember to not use all the starter at once and feed the remaining starter to always have it available.\n5. Storing the starter: store the starter in a closed container or jar in the fridge. The starter will survive almost indefinitely. After some time a vinegarish liquid forms on top of the starter. Don't be afraid of this, it is there to protect the starter from microbes. It can be poured away when you use the starter next time.\n6. When using the starter after long storage you need to activate it again. Feed it 1-2 times and see if bubbles form. You can also test the activity by placing small part into a glass of water.

Let it fill up about half an inch at the bottom.\n5. Heat oil at medium and place tofu, sauce, and minced garlic into pan. Adding sauce and herbs early helps tofu absorb the flavors.\n6.

The olive oil is one of the main flavors in this dish and it will taste significantly worse if you cheap out. Herbs, especially rosemary, don't even taste the same when comparing dried to fresh."
